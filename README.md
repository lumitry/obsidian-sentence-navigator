# Sentence Navigator

This [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin lets you manipulate sentences as a unit of movement. Select, move and delete by whole sentences. Credit for the [original idea](https://github.com/timhor/obsidian-editor-shortcuts/issues/3) goes to [@seatrout](https://github.com/seatrout). The movement and deletion commands now work; it needs polish from a professional before being released into the wild.
